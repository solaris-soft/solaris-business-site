# Legacy System Upgrade

If your company depends on a legacy codebase—outdated frameworks, security concerns, or technology that’s hard to maintain—we help you upgrade it to modern practices and current security standards. We assess what you have, plan a safe path forward, and do the work with minimal disruption so your business can keep operating while we modernise.

## What We Do

### Legacy Code Modernisation

We improve structure, readability, and maintainability of existing code without changing behaviour. That means clearer patterns, better separation of concerns, and a codebase your team can work with confidently.

### Security Hardening

Outdated systems are a security risk. We update dependencies, address known vulnerabilities, and apply current security best practices so your application meets today’s expectations and compliance needs.

### Framework & Dependency Upgrades

We move you off end-of-life or unsupported stacks onto actively maintained frameworks and libraries. That reduces risk, improves performance, and makes it easier to hire and onboard developers.

### Architecture Refactoring

Where it makes sense, we refactor toward clearer architecture—modularising monoliths, introducing APIs, or adopting cloud-friendly patterns—so the system can evolve instead of being replaced from scratch.

### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

We document the upgraded system and share how it works so your team can own it, extend it, and maintain it without depending on us long term.

## Why Upgrade Instead of Replace

1. **Preserve what works** — Your business logic and domain knowledge stay; we improve the technical foundation.
2. **Lower risk** — Incremental upgrades with testing and rollback options reduce the chance of big-bang failures.
3. **Control cost** — Modernising in stages is often more affordable than a full rewrite.
4. **Faster value** — You see improvements (security, performance, maintainability) as we go, not only at the end.

## Our Approach

1. **Assessment** — Review the codebase, dependencies, and deployment to identify risks and priorities.
2. **Roadmap** — Agree a phased plan: what to upgrade first, what to defer, and how to keep the system stable.
3. **Execution** — Implement upgrades in small, testable steps with automated tests and clear rollback paths.
4. **Handover** — Document changes, run knowledge-transfer sessions, and leave you with a maintainable, up-to-date system.

## Get in Touch

If you have a legacy system that needs upgrading to modern practices and security standards, we can help. Tell us about your stack and goals, and we’ll outline a practical path forward.
